This project involved creating a front-end replica of the Flipkart e-commerce platform, focusing on the user interface design. The key components include a responsive homepage, navigation bar, product listings, and various sections like offers, categories, and featured products. The use of CSS allowed for styling the layout to resemble the original Flipkart design, ensuring responsiveness across different screen sizes and devices. Through this project, you demonstrated your ability to implement modern web design principles and create visually appealing, user-friendly interfaces.
